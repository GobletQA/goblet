Resize options

1. Scale the Parent Region container to be the same height as the canvas element when ever there is a resize event
This will ensure the container matches the size of the browser

2. On region rescale, set the relative x or y based on the direction
  Basically works like a diagonal resize, where moving one direction with resize the other direction as well
