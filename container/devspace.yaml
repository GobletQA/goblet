# yaml-language-server: $schema=container/devspace.yaml
version: v1beta11

# Currently we have to define some variables in the yaml that we want to use outside the valuesFiles key in the deployment section
# https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace/issues/1716

# All vars are loaded from the getYamlValue.js script
# This allows them to be loaded from the current ENV, the values.yml files, or a fallback
# See the ../scripts/js/getYamlValue.js script for more information
